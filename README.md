# AI-Sequencium
Different AIs for Sequencium using reinforcement learning.

## DQN

A deep q-network.
After training for about 100,000 games, it is still fairly awful. It needs more training and an improved setup.
The basic design is inspired by [https://github.com/seungeunrho/minimalRL](https://github.com/seungeunrho/minimalRL)


## MCTS

A Monte Carlo Tree Search that currently works better than the DQN.
